# Documents-words-translater
This program get a text and then , extract the words who are not in the saved_words.txt file and then translates them.

I created objects in the objects.py , so at first read objects.py file
and make the graphics window and the program in the DocWord_translater.py file.
So if you want read the cods , I recommend at first read the objects in the objects.py and then read DocWord_translater.py file.

I also got an exe output from this program whose name is DocWord_translater.exe
